# AST2050 Optical Design

## Problem #1

The main parameters are:

	focal_length = 30
	aperture = 30

The performance metrics are:

	lit.print "Length: #{A+B} mm"
	lit.print "Magnification: #{A / D} (ideal: 0.25)"

The requirements are:

	assert A > 40, "A must be > 40mm"
	assert A + B < 400, "Total length must be < 400mm"
	assert A/D < 0.25, "Magnification must not be too high"
