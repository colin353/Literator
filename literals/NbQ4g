# Phase II Schedule Validator

This file is designed to help validate that everything will be proceeding on schedule, before the **ultimate deadline**.
	ultimate_deadline = moment "April 15, 2014"
Now we have to list all of the dependencies. There are three phases of dependencies 
which need to be met independently.
	dependencies = []
## Lab Preparation

The main items in laboratory preparation are:

1. Physical support mechanism
2. Electrical systems
3. Cooling systems 
4. Vacuum systems
5. Electronics rack mounting systems

### Physical support, electrical and cooling

These dates were given in an email.
	dependencies.push = { 
		name: "Physical support mechanism, electrical and cooling",
		date: moment("February 13 2014").add 'weeks', 7
	}
### Vacuum

According to the manufacturers, the average lead time is 6-8 weeks.
	vacuum = {
		purchase_date: moment "February 24, 2014",
		lead_time: 8
	}
	
	dependencies.push = { 
		name: "Vacuum systems"
		date: vacuum.purchase_date.add 'weeks', vacuum.lead_time
	}
## Validation

Here, we validate the dates. Check the code below for errors.
	for d in dependencies
		assert ultimate_deadline.diff(d.date) > 0, "Date invalid for #{d.name}, reporting completion on #{d.date.toString()}"
