# Constraints design test

The main parameters in this design study are `A`: the distance between the image sensor and the lens, and `B`: the distance between the lens and the object.
	:variable A between 40 and 100
	:variable D between 160 and 360
## Design Parameters

The lens we have chosen is from ThorLabs.
	focal_length = 60.0
	lens_diameter = 50.8
## Constraint Specification

The primary constraints are:

- The total length `A + D` must not exceed 400 mm
- The sensor to lens distance (`A`) must not be less than 40 mm
- The aperture stop must not be larger than the lens diameter.
- The system must be in focus, according to the lens equation.
	:constraint A + D < 400
	:constraint A / D < 0.25
	:constraint D / 6.25 < lens_diameter
	:solve
The results are in:
	lit.print "Sensor distance (A): #{A} mm"
	lit.print "Object distance (D): #{D} mm"
	lit.print "Aperture size: #{D / 6.25} mm"
