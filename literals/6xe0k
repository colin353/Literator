# AST2050 Optical Design

## Problem #1

The main parameters are:
	A = 45.5 # The length between the CCD and lens
	C = "unknown" # The aperture size
	D = "unknown" # The distance between the lens and subject
Our choice of lens from ThorLabs is the LA1422

http://www.thorlabs.com/thorproduct.cfm?partnumber=LA1422

Which has the following parameters:
	focal_length = 40
	lens_diameter = 25
The focal plane is defined by the equation `1/f = 1/i + 1/o`. In our case, the focal length is `focal_length`, the object is located at distance `D` and the image should be at `A`.
	D = 1.0 / ( 1/focal_length - 1/A )
The operating f-ratio must be `6.25`, which will just set our aperture
	C = focal_length / 6.25
### Performance Metrics

Below, we can see the performance metrics for the design.
	lit.print "Length: #{A+D} mm"
	lit.print "Aperture size: #{C} mm"
	lit.print "Sensor distance (A): #{A} mm"
	lit.print "Object distance (D): #{D} mm"
	lit.print "F-ratio: #{focal_length/C} (ideal: 6.25)"
	lit.print "Magnification: #{A / D} (ideal: 0.25)"
##CONSOLE##	assert D+A < 400, "The total size must be under 400 mm"
	assert D > 0 && A > 0 && C > 0, "All parameters must be positive."
	assert A/D < 0.25, "Magnification must not be too high"
	assert lens_diameter > C, "The aperture stop must be smaller than the lens size."
	lit.print "All design assertions passed."
