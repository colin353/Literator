# AST2050 Optical Design

## Problem #1

The main parameters are:
	aperture = 30
	
	A = 40 # The length between the CCD and lens
	C = aperture # The aperture size
	D = 250 # The distance between the lens and subject
The performance metrics are:
	lit.print "Length: #{A+D} mm"
	lit.print "F-ratio: #{C/D} (ideal: 6.25)"
	lit.print "Magnification: #{A / D} (ideal: 0.25)"
##CONSOLE##	assert A >= 40, "A must be > 40mm"
	assert D/C == 6.25, "Operating f-ratio is incorrect."
	assert A + B < 400, "Total length must be < 400mm"
	assert A/D < 0.25, "Magnification must not be too high"
