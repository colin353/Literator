# Constraints design test

The main parameters in this design study are `A`: the distance between the image sensor and the lens, and `B`: the distance between the lens and the object.
	:variable A between 40 and 100
## Design Parameters

The lens we have chosen is from ThorLabs.
	focal_length = 40.0
	lens_diameter = 50.8
## Constraint Specification

The primary constraints are:

- The total length `A + D` must not exceed 400 mm
- The sensor to lens distance (`A`) must not be less than 40 mm
- The aperture stop must not be larger than the lens diameter.
- The system must be in focus, according to the lens equation.
	D = ->
		d = 1 / ( 1 / focal_length - 1 / A )
		if d > 1e10 
	    	return d = 1e10
	 	else 
	      	return d
Note that we also want to constraint this: 
`:constraint D() / 6.25 < lens_diameter`
but for now we'll leave it as unconstrained.
	:constraint A + D() < 400
	:constraint A / D() < 0.25
	:constraint D() > 0
	:solve
The results are in:
	lit.print "Sensor distance (A): #{A} mm"
	lit.print "Object distance (D): #{D()} mm"
	lit.print "Aperture size: #{focal_length / 6.25} mm"
	lit.print "Magnification: #{A/D()} (ideal: 0.25)"
